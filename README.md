# Filter Plugin:
1. `nested_service_interfaces(services)` function:
This function takes a list of services as input and processes them to return a list of tuples containing a service and one of its interfaces.

- The function starts by initializing an empty list called result.
- It then iterates through each service in the services list.
- For each service, it iterates through the key-value pairs of the 'sides' dictionary using side_key, side_value in service['sides'].items().
- It further iterates through the interfaces list within the side_value dictionary.
- For each interface, it appends a tuple (service, interface) to the result list.
- If an exception occurs during the process, the function raises an AnsibleFilterError with a relevant error message.

2. FilterModule class:
This class is necessary for creating an Ansible filter plugin. It has a single method called filters() that returns a dictionary containing the filter name (in this case, 'nested_service_interfaces') as the key and the corresponding function (in this case, the nested_service_interfaces() function) as the value.

The filter can be used in an Ansible playbook to process a list of services from a YAML file (e.g., service.yaml) and generate a list of tuples containing a service and its interfaces. This makes it easier to work with nested data structures in playbooks when performing tasks related to the services and their interfaces.
